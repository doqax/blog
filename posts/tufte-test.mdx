Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.

Tufte CSS was created by [Dave Liepmann](https://google.com) and [Testing](/posts/testing) is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from Tufte-LaTeX and R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.

If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: tufte-css. Please note the contribution guidelines.

## Getting Started

To use Tufte CSS, copy tufte.css and the et-book directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s head block:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/>
```

Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.

## Fundamentals

### Sections and Headings

Organize your document with an article element inside your body tag. Inside that, use section tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.

> [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of sentences which then cumulate sequentially into paragraphs, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize. 

> <footer> Testing something</footer>

As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using blockquote and footer elements. See page 20 of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information for an example in print.

In _Tufte CSS_ they are just **lightly styled**, semantically correct HTML using blockquote and footer elements.

But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a p tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.

If you need a full-width figure, give it the fullwidth class. Make sure that’s inside an article, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.

<Figure src="/images/napoleons-march.png" alt="this is an image" fullwidth />

## Code

Hello world world world world

```jsx
// import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";
import Date from "components/Date/Date";
import Sidenote from "./Sidenote/Sidenote";
import Figure from "./Figure/Figure";
import Code from "./Code/Code";

const components = {
  TestComponent: ({ name }) => <div>Hello ${name}</div>,
  Sidenote: ({ note, withNumber, id }) => (
    <Sidenote note={note} withNumber={withNumber} id={id} />
  ),
  Figure: (props) => <Figure {...props} />,
  code: (props) => <Code {...props} />,
};

export default function Article({ source, date, title }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>
        <Date dateString={date} />
      </div>
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </article>
  );
}
```
