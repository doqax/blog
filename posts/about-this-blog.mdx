It's difficult to get anything done with all the noise on the web. The goal of this blog is :

* To stay away from traditional media and maintain an illusion of connection with the world.
* To improve my writing skills in English. It's bad at the moment but sufficient for everything related to CS.
* To spend more time creating instead of passively consuming media.
* To document my journey learning CS.

## What led me to this blog
### I quit my job

Consulting can be really bad as a developer. You don't own the product, you don't have any incentives (quite the contrary) to care about the quality of your work. Two years from now, you'll never see the code you wrote, so it's easy to claim you'll never learn anything about it.

Once I realized that, I couldn't focus on my work without putting everything into perspective. 

* Why should we use this tech over this one ? <Sidenote note="Responses are always the same. The client doesn't want to. It's time consuming. One day we'll do it. Their goal is always to reduce time/cost, but they end up shooting themselves in the foot by delaying technical debt. Also a developer without free will is a program." />
* Could we implement X into this project ?
* Can I work on something else this time ?

There was a pattern. Most decisions were made without really thinking about medium to long term consequences, and it was all about going fast. Which means clients will probably have to refactor our work down the line and pay the price. Most of the codes and architecture had a planned obsolescence by design, or rather, because of laziness intertwined with ignorance or stupidity. And it's not just within this company, it's all over the industry. 

There is no way to transmit feedback effectively from bottom to top. When you're at the bottom you actually have to put your job on the line, and therefore increase cost if they don't take your argument into consideration. Most managers will bail out and refuse to escalade the problem. Too risky for them. If they do you're at risk of putting more work on your colleagues table. You basically have to choose between slowly building resentment towards you or lying to yourself. Once I realized I couldn't have any leverage on this, I was elsewhere. It's impossible for me to work without a meaningful reason.

Afterward I looked around me, searching for answers. Employees working there had families, an exciting beer to drink at the end of the week, hobbies, a [meditation](https://www.washington.edu/news/2022/03/03/mindfulness-meditation-can-reduce-guilt-leading-to-unintended-negative-social-consequences/) routine or they were pursuing a management career. No one truly cared about what they were doing technically, and the ones who did ended up quitting. I have nothing against this mindset, but, to be *happy*, you basically *have* to find meaning outside of work. This was pernicious and led me to have a burnout : what I did was useless for the end users<Sidenote withNumber note="B2B, they don't care once they signed the contract. It's mostly peacocking for BM." />, the company and working there was detrimental to my progress.

In that case having a burnout is a good thing, it means you actually care about what you do, but your environment prevents you to do it. That's it. The sooner you react, the least amount of time you'll need to get better. Once I realized that, it was just a question of days/weeks before I decided to quit. It's also healthier to proceed that way, just to make sure these environments get out of business as soon as possible.

As of today, I rely on healthy food, good sleep habits, a schedule and sport. If you have good foundations, you'll be fine no matter what you do. It's the same as removing useless dependencies. This is the best advice I can give to be resilient against burnout. I also started writing for this reason alone. I can reflect, progress and quickly change direction if it doesn't work. Highly recommend it.


### Quest for meaning

After three months reading books like a mad man, I went back at it. I was afraid to never open a code editor again. I started following [this website](https://teachyourselfcs.com). I'm still reading SICP. Deep learning can be troublesome and time consuming, but it's the only way to progress. I'm still struggling to be consistent but it's getting better. 

What I lack is guidance; Senior Developers (40+) are a really rare species. What helped me to arrive at this conclusion is Leonard De Vinci's biography and Apprenticeship Pattern<Sidenote withNumber note="I'll write a post on this because remapping the way you learn is a really interesting topic." />. It changed my priorities as a developer. Iteration and failure are our biggest tools. Unfortunately, this mindset is still controversial in Europe and difficult to apply without capital.


### Learning to say no

In the past, I always had to choose a company in a rush due to personal problems or insufficient funds. Now I'd like to build stuff on my own and be responsible for the decisions I make and see where it leads me. I think people (myself included) would be surprised to see what they can build if only they had some leverage on their situation.

For the first time I've said no to some opportunities, just because it doesn't fit the way things should be done. I'm done accepting wrong decisions and having to deal with them. I already live in Belgium, it's enough for me.

### Loneliness

It has been difficult to live up to my values, to become a better man. I sometimes feel like nobody is on the same page as I am. People tend to criticize what they don't understand and it has been really humbling to learn this. I have done the same in the past. This alone is a good reason to confront my ideas to the world, and to keep on learning.
