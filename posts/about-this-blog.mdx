It's difficult to get anything done with all the noise on the web. The goal of this blog is :

* To stay away from traditional/social media and maintain an illusion of connection with the world.
* To improve my writing skills in English. It's bad at the moment but sufficient for everything related to CS.
* To spend more time creating instead of passively consuming media.
* To document my journey learning CS.

## What led me to this blog
### I quit my job

Consulting can be really bad as a developer. You don't own the product, you don't have any incentives (quite the contrary) to care about the quality of your work. Two years from now, you'll never see the code you wrote, so it's easy to claim you'll never learn anything about it.

Once I realized that, I couldn't focus on my work without putting everything into perspective. 

* Why should we use this tech over this one ? <Sidenote note="Responses are always the same. The client doesn't want to. It's time consuming. One day we'll do it. Their goal is always to reduce time/cost, but they end up shooting themselves in the foot by delaying technical debt. Also a developer without free will is a computer." />
* Could we implement X into this project ?
* Can I work on back-end this time ?

There was a pattern. Most decisions were made without really thinking about medium to long term consequences, and it was all about going fast. Which means clients will probably have to refactor our work down the line and pay the price. Most of the codes and architecture had a planned obsolescence by design, or rather, because of laziness intertwined with ignorance and stupidity. And it's not just within this company, it's all over the industry.

Afterward I looked around me, searching for answers. Most developers working there had families, an exciting beer to drink at the end of the week, hobbies, etc. No one truly cared about what they were doing, and the ones who did ended up quitting. I have nothing against this mindset, but, to be happy, you basically have to find meaning outside of work in this kind of environment. This was pernicious and led me to have a burnout. It was the realization that what I did was useless for the end users<Sidenote withNumber note="B2B, they don't care once they signed the contract. It's mostly peacocking for BM." />, my colleagues/company and the fact that working there was detrimental to my progress. 

### Quest for meaning

After two/three months reading books like a mad man, I went back at it. I was afraid to never touch a computer again. I started following [this website](https://teachyourselfcs.com). I'm still reading SICP. Deep learning can be troublesome and time consuming, but it's the only way to progress. I'm still struggling to be consistent but it's getting better.

One thing I rely on a day to day basis is focussing on healthy food, good sleep habits, a schedule<Sidenote withNumber note="I tend to be too optimistic though" /> and sport. It's all about habits after all. If you have good foundations, you'll be fine no matter what you do.

### Learning to say no

In the past, I never had the time to choose the company I wanted to work for because of personal problems or "insufficient funds". Now I'd like to build stuff on my own and be responsible for the decisions I make and see where it leads me. I think people (myself included) would be surprised to see what they can build if only they had some leverage on their situation.

For the first time I've said no to some opportunities, just because it doesn't fit the way things should be done. I'm done accepting stupid decisions and having to deal with them. It's making me sick. I already live in Belgium, it's enough for me.

### Loneliness

It has been difficult to live up to my values, to become a better man. I sometimes feel like nobody is on the same page as I am. People tend to criticize what they don't understand and it has been really humbling to learn this. I have done the same in the past. This alone is a good reason to confront my ideas to the world, and to keep on learning.
